# Introduction to the IVT Faculty: A Journey by Helga Ingimundardóttir

Hello there! I'm Helga Ingimundardóttir, and this repository contains the LaTeX source files, figures, and associated resources for my introduction to the wonderful Industrial Engineering department at the University of Iceland. I've used the `hi-beamer` template, which I find gives presentations that extra touch of professionalism.

# Introduction to the Industrial Engineering Faculty: A Journey by Helga Ingimundardóttir

Hello there! I'm Helga Ingimundardóttir. This repository holds my introductory presentation to the incredible Industrial Engineering faculty at the University of Iceland. For this presentation, I used the `hi-beamer` template I created for the university.

## What's Inside:

- `main.tex`: The central heart of my presentation.
- `figs/`: Pictures and illustrations breathing life into my slides.
- `references.bib`: All the bibliographic files for my references.
- `hi-latex/`: The aesthetic files linked to the `hi-beamer` template.

## Compiling the Presentation:

To bring my presentation to life:

1. Navigate to the directory.
2. Use `pdflatex main.tex`.
3. For any citations, go for `bibtex main.aux`, then a couple more spins with `pdflatex main.tex`.

## A Glimpse at the Presentation:

I've put together slices of my academic journey, my spirited ventures into research, my ethos on teaching, and my aspirations for collaborative magic at the University of Iceland. It’s a tapestry of my past, present, and dreams.

## Connect with Me:

Your perspectives and feedback are invaluable. Whether it’s a brainwave, a suggestion, or just the seedling of a collaborative idea, reach out! Drop me an email at [helgaingim@hi.is] or spark a discussion right here in the repository.

## For the Curious:

For this presentation, I refactored and employed the hi-beamer template, tailored for the University of Iceland. If you're keen on exploring it or perhaps utilizing it for your own presentations, I've included it as a submodule.
